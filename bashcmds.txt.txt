wsl (ubuntu) and cmd are different OS
The files and folders can be accessed by both of them !!
But the installations and other things should be done seperately on both of them !!


pwd - gives the current path 
cd - change directory 
mkdir - make a folder 

ls - gives the list of folders and files in that path 

touch - make a file(txt,js,cpp etc...)
touch file_name.(extension)

cat - will give the content in that file
cat file_name

vi - editor (i - to write something
             esc q!-to quit wq! to save and quit )
mv source destinoation (Will move the file/folder to specified path)
cp -r source destination (will copy the file/folder to specidfied path)

cd .. (goes one path previous one step )
cd ../.. (two path two steps )
cd ../../..  and so on .......


In wsl ( sudo apt update )
to install something called node etc (sudo apt install node)
